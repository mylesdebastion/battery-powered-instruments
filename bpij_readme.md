Canonical public messaging (use verbatim)

Battery Powered Instrument Jam is a monthly community session at Woodstock Café. Bring a battery-powered instrument and headphones. We plug into a shared mixer for 90 minutes and explore guided, collaborative music making.

Woodstock Café is owned and operated by CymaSpace, a nonprofit for accessible, multisensory arts (incorporated 2014). Artistic direction and nonprofit stewardship by Myles de Bastion (founder, board president, artistic director), who leads the organization supporting grant writing, advocacy, and partnerships that keep gatherings like this going. The café is managed by Andre Gray (café manager and CymaSpace board member).
