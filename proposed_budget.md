## Revenue Scenarios (tickets + tip jar only)
- **Low:** 10 attendees; 50% Patreon → 5 pay × $8 avg = **$40** + tips $10 = **$50/event** → **$300/series**
- **Base:** 15 attendees; 40% Patreon → 9 pay × $10 avg = **$90** + tips $20 = **$110/event** → **$660/series**
- **High:** 20 attendees; 30% Patreon → 14 pay × $12 avg = **$168** + tips $40 = **$208/event** → **$1,248/series**

**Membership uplift (attributed):** assume +2 new $5/mo patrons per event → 12 patrons → **$60/mo**.  
If counted over a 6-month horizon: **$360** added to series revenue (org-wide, not door).

## Net Picture (Base revenue vs each option)
| Option     | 6-event OPEX | Ticket+tips (base) | Attributed Patreon (6-mo) | Net cash need (w/o Patreon) | Net after Patreon |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| A — Lean   | $240         | $660               | $360                       | **–$420** (surplus)         | **+$?** surplus   |
| B — Standard | $1,560     | $660               | $360                       | **$900**                    | **$540**          |
| C — Growth | $2,190       | $660               | $360                       | **$1,530**                  | **$1,170**        |

> Lean shows a surplus because labor is volunteer; Standard and Growth need subsidy via sponsorships, grants, or higher turnout.

## Break-even math (per event)
Let:
- `p` = average paid ticket net after fees (≈ $9.70 for $10 ticket)  
- `N_pay` = number of paying attendees  
- `R_other` = tips/small donations (base $20)  
- `Cost_event` = OPEX per event (Option B = $260)

**Break-even:** `N_pay ≥ (Cost_event − R_other) / p`  
For Option B base case: `(260 − 20) / 9.7 ≈ 24.7` → **~25 paying attendees**.  
To hit that with 15 total people, either (a) raise avg pay, (b) reduce costs, or (c) add a sponsor.

**Sponsor lever:** A $150/event sponsor drops Option B break-even to ~**10–11 paying** at $10.

## Recommendations
- **Pick Option B** as the default.  
- Seek **$900–$1,200 series sponsorship** (one local music shop or 2–3 micro-sponsors).  
- Keep **attendance caps** near 16 and rotate players to maintain quality.  
- Track **Patreon attribution** at check-in (QR + tag "BPIJ").  
- If turnout dips, pause paid videography and ad spend for the next event.
